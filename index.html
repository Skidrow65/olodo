          <p>
            Here are some of the problems that are being encountered within the community.
            <br /><span>(a)</span>Endless Treks: Imagine walking for miles under the scorching sun, carrying heavy containers, just to fetch water. Many people within this region face this reality daily.
            <br /><span>(b)</span>Time-Consuming: These long journeys steal precious time that could be spent on education, work, or leisure.
            <br /><span>(c)</span>Inadequate Water Supply: Many people within this region face this reality daily.
            <br /><span>(d)</span>Queues and Frustration: When multiple households rely on a single water source, queues form. People wait patiently, but frustration simmers as they jostle for their turn.
            <br /><span>(e)</span>Conflict: Tempers flare, especially during peak hours. Arguments erupt over who arrived first or whose turn it is.
            <br /><span>(f)</span>Drinking Water: The most fundamental need—clean drinking water—becomes scarce. Families ration it carefully, fearing it might run out.
            <br /><span>(g)</span>Hygiene and Cooking: Lack of water affects personal hygiene and cooking. Bathing, washing dishes, and preparing meals become challenging.
            <br /><span>(h)</span>Thirsty Livestock: Animals suffer alongside humans. Cattle, goats, and poultry need water to survive. Without it, they weaken, affecting livelihoods.
            <br /><span>(i)</span>Waterborne Diseases: Contaminated water breeds diseases like diarrhea, cholera, and dysentery. Children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable.
            <br /><span>(j)</span>Opportunity Cost: Time spent collecting water could be used for skill development or entrepreneurship.
            <br /><span>(k)</span>School Attendance: Children, especially girls, skip school to fetch water. Education takes a backseat to survival.
